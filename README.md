# Nixie Tube Watch
## Objective: Build an analog watch from scratch using cathode ray Nixie tubes from the 1950s.

    ✦ Designed printed circuit boards to keep the form factor of the watch as compact as possible.
    ✦ Created a Qi standard charging module for the watch to charge wirelessly.
    ✦ Built the watch case using resin and CNC-cut glass.
    ✦ Programmed the time functions of the watch in C.
    
## Design Process
    ✦ It took me around half a year to design the final PCB and gather all the components I needed for the watch.
        ✦ All the parts I used are in the 'nixie-list.xlsx' file for reference.   
        ✦ 'watch-PCB.png' contains a diagram of my PCB as well.
    ✦ I had minimal soldering and PCB design experience before making my nixie tube watch, so I learned most of these skills on the go lol.
